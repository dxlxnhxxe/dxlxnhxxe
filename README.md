## Hi there 👋

My name is Dylan, and I am a University of Bristol trained Computer Scientist interested in all things biology and medical!

- 🔭 I’m currently building a knowledge graph that models drug-disease relationships, connecting drugs, their targets and associated side effects.
- 🎮 My most current project is a [Text Adventure Game](https://github.com/dxlxnhxxe/Java---SimpleTextAdventureGame) where you explore locations by interacting with objects inside your terminal.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything medical technology related!
  - Contact me at dilancre8s@gmail.com

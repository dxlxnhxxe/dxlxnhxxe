## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dylan, and I am a University of Bristol trained Computer Scientist interested in all things biology and medical!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building a knowledge graph that models drug-disease relationships, connecting drugs, their targets and associated side effects.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything medical technology related!
- ðŸ‘¯ My most current project is a Text Adventure Game where you explore locations by interacting with objects inside your terminal.
  - Check it out [here](https://github.com/dxlxnhxxe/Java---SimpleTextAdventureGame)
